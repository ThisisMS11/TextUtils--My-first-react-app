There are two types of components in react js:-
1. Class based components
2. Function based components

Now react used functions based components more than class based components i.e.

What is JSX?
-------->
    function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">                   <---------------- Start
        <header className="App-header">                          
            <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
            <p>
            Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
            </p>
            <a
            className="App-link"
            href="https://reactjs.org"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"

            </a>
        </header>
        </div>                                   <-------------- End
    );
    }

from start to end what is written is jsx .

#while using jsx we have to make sure that we use following alternatives due to keyword reservation in js:-
class=className
for = For
